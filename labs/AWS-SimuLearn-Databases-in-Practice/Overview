🧪 Implementation Breakdown
1️⃣ RDS Deployment

Engine: MySQL

Instance class: db.t3.micro (lab configuration)

Storage: General Purpose (gp2/gp3)

Database identifier: simulearn-db

Public access: Disabled

VPC: Lab VPC

Subnet group: Private subnets

Outcome:
RDS instance successfully provisioned and available.

2️⃣ Security Configuration

To allow communication from the Web Server:

Security Group Modified:
DbServerSecurityGroup

Inbound Rule Added:

Type: MySQL/Aurora

Protocol: TCP

Port: 3306

Source: WebServerSecurityGroup

Why this approach:

Follows Principle of Least Privilege

Restricts access to only the application layer

Avoids exposing database to public internet

Uses Security Group referencing instead of CIDR

Because Security Groups are stateful:
Return traffic is automatically allowed.

3️⃣ Read Replica Setup

Read Replica was created to:

Improve read scalability

Reduce load on primary instance

Simulate production-grade scaling pattern

Key Observations:

Replica receives asynchronous replication

Used for read-only workloads

Not a backup solution

Does not automatically fail over (unless promoted)

🔐 Security Best Practices Applied

✔ Database in private subnet
✔ No 0.0.0.0/0 access on port 3306
✔ Separation of compute and data layers
✔ Security Group referencing
✔ Backup configuration enabled
✔ Multi-layer architecture design

📊 Key Concepts Practiced

Amazon RDS provisioning

VPC integration

Subnet group selection

Security Groups (stateful firewall behavior)

MySQL connectivity

Read Replica creation

Multi-tier architecture reasoning

🚩 Common Mistakes Avoided

Placing database in public subnet

Enabling public access unnecessarily

Opening MySQL to entire CIDR block

Modifying NACL instead of Security Group

Confusing Multi-AZ with Read Replica

🧠 Skills Demonstrated

Cloud architecture reasoning

Secure database configuration

Network-level troubleshooting

Infrastructure documentation

AWS service integration

Structured technical communication

📚 Learning Reflection

This lab strengthened my understanding of:

How databases integrate into cloud networking

The importance of controlled internal traffic

How read scaling differs from high availability

Why architecture design matters beyond simple deployment

This repository represents applied knowledge through hands-on configuration and structured documentation.

🔮 Next Steps

Implement Multi-AZ deployment for high availability

Compare RDS vs DynamoDB use cases

Simulate failure and promote read replica

Explore parameter groups and performance tuning

Implement automated backups and snapshot recovery

🧭 Learning Philosophy

This project was completed using a structured systems approach:

Input → Configuration → Security → Validation → Documentation

Every component is part of a larger architecture chain.
