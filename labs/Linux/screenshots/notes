🐧 Linux File System – Lab 233 Notes
1️⃣ Lab Purpose

This lab reinforces:

Linux directory management

File creation

Copying and moving files/folders

Deleting files and directories

Validating structure using CLI tools

Connecting to EC2 via SSH

It simulates a real-world company folder reorganization scenario.

2️⃣ Core Linux Commands Used
📍 Navigation Commands
pwd

Prints current working directory.

pwd

Example Output:

/home/ec2-user/CompanyA
cd

Changes directory.

cd foldername
cd ..
cd /home/ec2-user

Key concepts:

.. = parent directory

Absolute path starts with /

Relative path starts from current directory

ls

Lists files and folders.

ls
ls -la
ls -laR

Flags:

-l = long listing format

-a = show hidden files

-R = recursive (shows all subdirectories)

3️⃣ Directory Creation
mkdir

Creates new directory.

mkdir CompanyA
mkdir Finance HR Management

You can create multiple directories at once.

4️⃣ File Creation
touch

Creates empty files.

touch Salary.csv
touch file1.csv file2.csv

Important:

Does NOT add content

Creates empty placeholder files

5️⃣ Copying Files and Directories
cp
Copy file
cp file.txt destination/
Copy directory
cp -r Finance HR

⚠️ Important:

-r means recursive

Required when copying directories

Without -r, Linux will throw an error.

6️⃣ Moving Files and Directories
mv

Used to:

Move files

Move directories

Rename files

Example:

mv Management HR
mv file.txt Employees/

Key concept:
mv removes from original location automatically.

7️⃣ Deleting Files and Directories
rm

Deletes files.

rm file.csv

Delete multiple:

rm file1.csv file2.csv
rmdir

Removes empty directories ONLY.

rmdir Finance

If directory has files inside:

You will see:

Directory not empty
rm -r

Deletes directory and all contents recursively.

rm -r Finance

⚠️ Powerful command — use carefully.

8️⃣ File System Structure Concepts
Absolute Path

Starts from root:

/home/ec2-user/CompanyA/Finance
Relative Path

Based on current location:

cd ../Finance
9️⃣ Recursive Validation

To verify entire structure:

ls -laR

This:

Displays permissions

Shows ownership

Shows file sizes

Shows nested directory structure

🔟 SSH Connection Concepts

To connect to EC2:

ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@public-ip

Breakdown:

ssh = secure shell

-i = identity file

ec2-user = default Amazon Linux user

public-ip = EC2 instance address

Permission adjustment:

chmod 400 key.pem

This makes the key file read-only.

1️⃣1️⃣ Real-World Scenario

The lab simulates:

CompanyA restructuring departments:

Original:

CompanyA/
├── Finance
├── HR
└── Management

New structure:

CompanyA/
└── HR/
    ├── Finance
    ├── Management
    └── Employees

This represents:

Organizational restructuring

Department merging

File migration

1️⃣2️⃣ Common Errors & Lessons Learned

❌ Trying to use rmdir on non-empty folder
✔ Solution: Remove files first OR use rm -r

❌ Forgetting -r when copying directory
✔ Solution: Always use cp -r for folders

❌ Wrong path usage
✔ Use pwd frequently

❌ Not verifying changes
✔ Use ls after every step

1️⃣3️⃣ Key Linux Skills Reinforced

CLI confidence

File hierarchy understanding

Relative vs absolute path awareness

Recursive operations

Safe deletion practices

SSH connectivity
