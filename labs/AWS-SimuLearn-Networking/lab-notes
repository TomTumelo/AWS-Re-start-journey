🌐 AWS SimuLearn: Networking
📘 Overview

This repository documents my hands-on practice and conceptual understanding of AWS networking concepts through SimuLearn labs.

The focus is on building, configuring, and troubleshooting core networking components inside a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

This is part of my structured learning journey toward mastering AWS Cloud fundamentals.

🎯 Objectives

Understand how AWS networking components interact

Configure secure communication between services

Apply best practices for traffic control and segmentation

Strengthen troubleshooting and architecture reasoning skills

🧠 Core Concepts Covered
🔹 Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

CIDR block configuration

Logical network isolation

Public vs Private design patterns

🔹 Subnets

Public subnet configuration

Private subnet configuration

Multi-tier architecture layout

🔹 Route Tables

Internet Gateway routing

Internal VPC communication

Route propagation behavior

🔹 Internet Gateway (IGW)

Enabling public internet access

Attaching IGW to VPC

Public subnet routing logic

🔹 NAT Gateway

Allowing private subnet outbound internet access

Secure internal resource architecture

🔹 Security Groups

Stateful firewall behavior

Inbound vs Outbound rules

Instance-to-instance communication

MySQL (Port 3306) configuration between Web and DB servers

🔹 Network ACLs (NACLs)

Stateless traffic filtering

Rule ordering and evaluation

Subnet-level security control

🏗️ Architecture Scenario Practiced

Example lab scenario:

Web Server (10.10.0.0/24)
⬇
Security Group allows TCP 3306
⬇
DB Server (10.10.2.0/24)

Key learning:
Security Groups are stateful and should allow inbound MySQL traffic from the WebServerSecurityGroup rather than opening CIDR-wide access.

🔐 Security Best Practices Applied

Principle of Least Privilege

Avoiding 0.0.0.0/0 for database access

Using Security Group referencing for internal communication

Separating public-facing and private resources

🧪 Skills Demonstrated

Network troubleshooting

Traffic flow analysis

CIDR reasoning

Architecture diagram interpretation

Secure AWS configuration
