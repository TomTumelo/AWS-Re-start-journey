🚀 EC2 Instance Setup Lab

AWS re/Start Journey – Compute Module

📌 Project Overview

This lab demonstrates how to:

Launch an Amazon EC2 instance

Configure networking and security groups

Deploy an Apache web server using User Data

Monitor the instance

Resize instance type and EBS storage

Enable and test termination protection

🧱 Task 1: Launch EC2 Instance
Step 1: Access EC2 Dashboard

Accessed the AWS Management Console and selected EC2.

Step 2: Launch Instance

Clicked Launch Instance.

Step 3: Name and Tags

Name: Web Server

Step 4: Choose AMI

Amazon Linux

Free Tier: Amazon Linux Kernel 6.1

Step 5: Instance Type

Selected: t3.micro

Reason: Free tier eligible and sufficient for basic web hosting

Step 6: Key Pair

Proceeded without key pair (Lab environment)

Step 7: Networking

VPC: Lab VPC

Security Group Name: Web Server security group

Removed default inbound rules

Step 8: Storage Configuration

Default 8 GiB Amazon EBS root volume

Explanation:
Amazon EC2 uses Elastic Block Store (EBS) as network-attached storage.

Step 9: Advanced Details – User Data Script

Enabled Termination Protection

Added the following User Data script:

#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Welcome to My Web Server</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html


This script:

Installs Apache

Starts the service

Enables it on boot

Creates a test webpage

Step 10: Launch Instance

Clicked Launch Instance
Verified instance state = Running

📊 Task 2: Monitor Instance

Downloaded monitoring metrics.
Observed CPU utilization and instance health.

🌐 Task 3: Update Security Group

Initially, HTTP traffic was blocked.

Problem:

Unable to access web server using Public IPv4.

Solution:

Edited Inbound Rules:

Type: HTTP

Source: Anywhere (IPv4)

After saving rules, the web server became accessible.

🔄 Task 4: Resize Instance
Stop Instance

Stopped the EC2 instance before modification.

Change Instance Type

From: t3.micro

To: t3.small

Resize EBS Volume

Increased storage from 8 GiB to larger size

Modified volume under Elastic Block Store

Restart Instance

Started instance after resizing.

🔐 Task 5: Termination Protection

Attempted to terminate instance.

❌ Failed due to enabled termination protection.

Disabled termination protection.

Successfully terminated the instance.

🎯 Key Concepts Learned

EC2 Instance Lifecycle

Security Groups as Firewalls

Apache Web Server Deployment

User Data Automation

EBS Volume Resizing

Termination Protection

VPC & Networking Basics

💡 Reflection

This lab strengthened my understanding of compute services in AWS and how infrastructure can be configured, secured, monitored, and scaled.
