# AWS Hybrid Cloud Solution for a Café

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **hybrid cloud architecture using AWS services** designed for a small café that is not fully migrated to the cloud.

The solution improves **reliability, security, scalability, and cost efficiency** while allowing the business to transition gradually instead of moving everything at once.

---

## 🏪 Business Scenario
The café currently uses:
- On-premise systems for daily operations
- Limited online tools for basic services

### Challenges:
- System downtime during peak hours
- Risk of data loss from local storage
- High cost of maintaining physical hardware
- Difficulty scaling as the business grows

---

## ☁️ Proposed Cloud Solution
A **hybrid cloud approach** using AWS:
- Critical systems remain on-site
- Hosting, storage, databases, and backups move to AWS

This reduces risk and ensures a smooth cloud adoption process.

---

## 🧰 AWS Services Used
- **Amazon EC2** – Hosts applications and the café website
- **Amazon S3** – Stores files, backups, and static website content
- **Amazon RDS** – Managed relational database service
- **AWS IAM** – Controls user access and permissions
- **Amazon CloudWatch** – Monitors system performance and logs

---

## 🧩 Architecture Overview
Users access the café’s system hosted on **Amazon EC2**.  
Application data is stored in **Amazon RDS**, while files and backups are stored in **Amazon S3**.  
**AWS CloudWatch** monitors performance and **IAM** ensures secure access.
