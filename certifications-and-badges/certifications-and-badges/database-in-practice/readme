🗄️ Databases in Practice – SimuLearn (Full Flow)
1️⃣ Understand the Scenario (Solution Request)

You’re migrating from:

On-premises Windows database

File server

Linked application

Goal:

Move to AWS

Improve scalability

Add high availability

Reduce downtime

2️⃣ Deploy the Primary Database (Amazon RDS)

Choose engine (usually MySQL)

Enable:

Multi-AZ deployment

Choose:

Instance size

Storage

Configure:

VPC

Subnets

Security group (allow MySQL 3306)

✅ Outcome:
Primary RDS database running in Multi-AZ (high availability).

3️⃣ Launch Application Servers (EC2)

Launch EC2 instances

Place them in:

Same VPC

Different Availability Zones

Install application / connect to DB

Security:

EC2 → allowed to access RDS

Proper security group rules

✅ Outcome:
Application servers can communicate with the primary database.

4️⃣ Add a Load Balancer

Create Application Load Balancer

Register EC2 instances

Configure health checks

✅ Outcome:
Traffic distributed across multiple app servers.

This improves:

Reliability

Fault tolerance

🔁 5️⃣ Create a Read Replica (This Is The Important Part)

Now scaling reads.

From RDS:

Select primary DB

Click Actions

Choose Create Read Replica

Deploy in:

Different AZ (or region depending on lab)

What happens:

Primary DB → replicates data → Read Replica

Replica is:

Read-only

Used for heavy SELECT queries

6️⃣ Redirect Read Traffic to Replica

Application configuration:

Write operations → Primary DB

Read operations → Read Replica

This:

Reduces load on primary

Improves performance

Allows horizontal scaling

7️⃣ Multi-AZ High Availability

Multi-AZ means:

Primary DB in AZ-A

Standby DB in AZ-B

Automatic failover

If AZ-A fails:
AWS promotes standby automatically.

Zero manual intervention.

🧠 What This Lab Is Testing You On

You demonstrated:

RDS deployment

Multi-AZ architecture

Read replica scaling

EC2 + RDS integration

Load balancing

High availability principles

Disaster recovery concepts

This is real cloud architecture thinking.
